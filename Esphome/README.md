# Thermostat - Esphome Home Assistant - Nextion-3.2 inches Modifyed to 2.4 inch and from italian to english  tft file is for 2.4 inch 



This version allows you to manage the thermostat via Home Assistant and in the absence of the server simply ON / OFF in manual mode touch nextion.
To carry out the project with logic even in the absence of Home Assistant and therefore in offline mode, I refer you to the specific version, always in my repository. Link project later
